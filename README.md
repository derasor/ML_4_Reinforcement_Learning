* Apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.
* After investigating the environment the agent operates in by constructing a very basic driving implementation, each possible state the agent can be in is identified.
* Implement and improve a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time, finding the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure consistently positive results.
